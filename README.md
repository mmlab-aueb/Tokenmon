# Tokenmon

**_Abstract_** - We leverage the InterPlanetary File System~(**IPFS**) and Non-Fungible Tokens~(**NFTs**) backed by Distributed Ledger Technologies (**DLTs**) to build a flexible, decentralized, and fair baseline system for trading games. Our solution creates a **fully decentralized** system, where new business models are enabled, as the evolvable assets of the games can be resold and priced depending on their rarity, giving also a cut to the digital artist, without the need for a trusted party. The system guarantees that assets will remain online, thus the users do not risk losing control over the artefacts or their value, even if the creator game company loses interest or goes bankrupt.
